# AMD AM5 processor profiles in Open Hardware Control 3.4.16 INTERNAL

The profiles only control the supported NZXT Kraken cooling hardware. Pump and radiator-fan curves now use CPU temperature directly. CPU Tjmax and Kraken liquid temperature remain separate quantities.

## Rules

- Ryzen 9000, Ryzen 8000G and listed standard Ryzen 7000 models: AMD Tjmax 95 °C, stronger cooling from 80 °C, both CPU curves at 100% by 90 °C.
- Ryzen 7000 X3D: AMD Tjmax 89 °C, stronger cooling from 75 °C, both CPU curves at 100% by 85 °C.
- The controller interpolates linearly between five CPU points. An EMA smooths brief spikes; rising demand reacts faster than falling demand.
- Kraken liquid: warning at 42 °C, critical at 50 °C, optional automatic 100% at the critical threshold.
- A clean application exit stores conservative liquid-temperature curves as an autonomous hardware fallback.

Each profile also contains the corresponding official AMD product page in source code. Profiles are conservative application defaults, not a guarantee for every case, ambient temperature or workload.
